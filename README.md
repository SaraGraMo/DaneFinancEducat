Data Visualization in R for Statistics in Social Science has increased in
recent years due to several applications such as social media, gender
studies, and labour market, among others. This work combines some plots
of data visualization in R with some initial quantitative methods in order to
analyze a survey applied to Colombian families. The database consists on
19,416 homes in 2017. We show some examples of visualization such as
ggplot. In the statistical examples we present univariate and bivariate
analysis of variables related to financial burden in the families. We
compared the result between three main cities in Colombia. Some results
indicate that the families use their remaining money from their basic
expenses for three objectives: for save, for house purchase and for
emergencies
